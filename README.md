# Distributed-Robot-System

A distributed robot system using Robot Operating System (ROS) capable of basic Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM).  

This repo contains code to operate a robotic platform which runs on four devices:
* A Raspberry Pi (for servo control, rotary encoder data and webcam data)
* An Android device (for gyroscope data)
* An Arduino Uno (for motor control and ultrasonic distance sensor data)
* A laptop (for GUI and remote control)
